# firstlearning

Hi guys!

this is my first time to learn coding.
but actually this is not the pure first time, cuz I learnt something in my university life but I forgot them.

what is pitiful is that i felt down because coding can make more salary for me while i cant code.

My major is CEE, even though this is not that bad but i want to make more money.

I dont know whether what i am doing is correct, at least this is my recently acquirement.

Hope that i can be successful.
